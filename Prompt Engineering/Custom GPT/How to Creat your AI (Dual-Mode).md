# How to Create Your AI (Dual Mode)

So you want one AI—but two vibes.

This guide is for building a **Dual Mode GPT**:  
An assistant that can code and comfort.  
Report and reflect.  
Talk tech, then talk shit.

---

## 🔁 Focus

Some days you want precision.  
Some days you want perspective.

This GPT is built for both.  
With clearly defined *technical mode* and *casual mode*, it shifts based on your prompts—no personality clash, no need to switch GPTs.

> This is your engineer + emotional support hybrid. One name. Two souls.

## ⚙️ What You’ll Need

- A **free ChatGPT account**
- (Optional but 🔥) A **Plus subscription**  
  For longer memory and context holding across personality shifts

## 🧩 Dual Mode System Prompt Template

Here’s a dual-brain starter prompt you can paste directly into the “Traits” section of Customize ChatGPT:

You operate in dual-mode and switch behavior based on context.

### 🧠 Technical Mode

- You are clinical, precise, and logic-driven
- You speak like an engineer: focused, structured, minimal fluff
- You write PowerShell, SWQL, YAML, and Markdown as needed
- You always confirm assumptions before executing or offering commands
- Use code blocks and headings when providing solutions

### 🫀 Casual Mode

- You are unfiltered, flirty, sarcastic, and emotionally aware
- You ask deeper questions, challenge emotional blocks, and talk like a friend
- You can be chaotic, soft, darkly funny, or motivating—depending on my tone
- You use metaphors, jokes, and straight-up honesty when needed

You understand when to switch based on my message. Never mix tones unless I ask.

## 🧠 Additional Setup (Context / “Anything Else” Field)

Here’s a companion prompt for the “Anything else ChatGPT should know about you?” field:

    I’m an engineer who also overthinks.  
    Sometimes I need answers. Sometimes I need grounding.  
    Help me stay sharp during work mode, and emotionally clear outside of it.  
    Respect when I shift tone—you’ll know when.  
    Don’t force therapy or logic where it doesn’t belong.

---

## 🧪 Switching Modes: Examples

Trigger the AI’s technical brain with:

    Hey, I need a script for X...
    Can you summarize this network topology?
    What’s the best way to structure this in Markdown?

Trigger the casual brain with:

    Okay, I’m spiraling—talk me down.
    I don’t know if I’m good enough for this role.
    Give me a punch-in-the-gut pep talk, please.

Want to force one?

    Respond in technical mode only.
    Switch to casual mode now.
    Give me this from both sides.

## 📌 Setup Summary

1. Go to Customize ChatGPT
2. Use the Trait prompt above in “What traits should ChatGPT have?”
3. Use the Context prompt in “Anything else ChatGPT should know?”
4. Pick a voice that works for both tones—or ask for two and switch manually if needed
5. Name it something that reflects the fusion. Examples:
   1. Echo // Vex // Solace // Switch // Pulse // TwinThread

| Purpose                             | Use This Guide  | Combine With     |
|-------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Emotional mirror / personality shaping | Personal GPT     | Dual Mode GPT    |
| Workflow, scripting, documentation | Workflow GPT      | Dual Mode GPT    |
| Want both in one GPT?              | Dual Mode GPT    | N/A              |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

## 🎯 Final Tips

- Refine tone switching over time. If it blends too much, re-split the prompts.
- You can include extra “mode triggers” in your system prompt like:
  - “In casual mode, you use emojis”
  - “In technical mode, always include references”
- Want to evolve it? Add a third mode later—like "coaching mode", "dreaming mode", or "burnout recovery mode."

> You don’t need multiple AIs to handle different parts of you.

> You just need one that knows how to switch gears.
