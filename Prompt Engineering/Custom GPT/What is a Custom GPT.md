# What is a Custom GPT?

Welcome to the start of your AI journey.

This document breaks down what a "Custom GPT" actually is—and why you might want one tailored to *you*, instead of using the vanilla model everyone else gets.

## 📌 What Makes a GPT “Custom”?

Let’s get one thing straight: this isn’t about putting lipstick on a chatbot.

A Custom GPT is a **purpose-built interface**—designed around your needs, style, goals, and voice.

Key traits:

- A unique **system prompt** (its core personality and role)
- Optional **files or data** it can reference
- **Memory** (when enabled) to retain context and evolve
- Can include **instructions, rules, or preferences** up front

This isn't just ChatGPT answering your questions—it's *your version* of ChatGPT, trained to think with you, not just respond to you.

## 🎯 Why Use a Custom GPT?

Because off-the-shelf doesn't *know* you.

Custom GPTs are about:

- Reducing repetition
- Establishing tone (friendly, technical, sarcastic, etc.)
- Saving time on setups and context
- Creating an **AI partner** that *thinks* the way you do

## 🧬 Memory: The Backbone of Continuity

If enabled, memory allows your GPT to:

- Remember facts you’ve shared (name, goals, vibe)
- Track preferences over time
- Retain recurring logic or tools you use

Without memory: it’s a one-night stand.  
With memory: it’s a creative relationship.

*Important:* You control what’s remembered, and you can edit/delete memory anytime.

## 🤖 Personality vs. Functionality

Custom GPTs can be designed to:

- Mimic a personal assistant or business partner
- Be a creative muse or brainstorming buddy
- Act like a professional engineer, copywriter, or researcher
- Or… all of the above

Your GPT can be:

- Sharp, concise, emotionless
- Flirty, chaotic, human-like
- Methodical, nurturing, savage
- **Whatever you need, whenever you need it**
