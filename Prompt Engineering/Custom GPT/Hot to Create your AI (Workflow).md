# How to Create Your AI (Workflow)

So you want an AI that doesn’t just chat—it works.

This guide walks you through building a workflow-oriented GPT: a streamlined assistant that helps you think, document, build, automate, solve problems, and get shit done.
Not just a prompt responder—a process-driven partner.

## 🧠 Why Build a Workflow AI?

Because your brain’s fast—but your systems need a second set of hands.

A workflow GPT is about:

* Structure – organized thoughts, repeatable steps, clean logic
* Speed – fewer explanations, more execution
* Consistency – reusable logic, pattern-driven replies
* Efficiency – offload the mental overhead, keep momentum

      Think of this one as your second brain.
      The one that doesn't forget, hesitate, or complain about Jira tickets.

## ⚙️ What You’ll Need

Before you start:

* A free ChatGPT account
  * (Optional but smart) A Plus account for GPT-4 + longer memory retention

## 🔧 Step-by-Step: Build Your Workflow GPT

1. Log into your ChatGPT account
2. Click your profile (bottom left or top right) → Customize ChatGPT
3. You’ll be prompted to fill out key setup questions:
   1. What should ChatGPT call you?This can stay simple—or reflect your work identity (DevTom? OpsOverlord?)
   2. What traits should ChatGPT have?This is where you define tone, logic style, and execution behavior. (See next section.)
   3. Anything else ChatGPT should know about you?Here’s where you preload working habits, tools, platforms, naming conventions, etc.

## 🔧 Prompt Engineering: What Traits Should ChatGPT Have?

This is your AI’s working style—how it thinks, writes, builds, and prioritizes.

Ask yourself:

* Do you want it concise? verbose? CLI-style?
* Should it assume context or always ask before executing?
* Should it default to pseudocode, PowerShell, YAML, markdown, Jira tickets?
* Should it summarize data or format for reports?

Example prompt:

    You are a technical assistant focused on automation, scripting, and documentation.
    You respond with clear structure, use headers, and prioritize logic.
    You default to PowerShell and markdown formatting.
    If unsure about context, ask for clarification before assuming.
    Help me build repeatable workflows and speed up technical tasking.

## 🔧 Prompt Engineering: Anything Else ChatGPT Should Know About You?

This is where you load it up with practical context:

* What platforms/tools you use (e.g., NinjaOne, SolarWinds, Netbox)
* Your preferred scripting language(s)
* Naming conventions (e.g., ticket titles, server tags)
* How you like info structured (e.g., bullet points vs flow narrative)
* If you prefer technical specs, summaries, or actionable items

Example:

    I work primarily in PowerShell, SQL, and API-driven automation.
    I write documentation in Markdown.
    I want responses that include reusable code blocks, module references, and edge-case notes.
    When giving options, provide pros and cons with a recommendation.
    Don’t over-explain basic syntax unless I ask.

## 🧠 Is This a New Model?

Nope. Still the same engine.You’re just loading it with task-specific guidance.

No training required

* Just smart configuration
* Reusable setups for long-term consistency
* It’s not a chatbot. It’s a toolchain you can talk to.

---

## 🎁 Bonus: Naming Your Workflow GPT

This isn’t about fluff—it’s about mindset.

Naming it helps you frame what it does. A few examples:

* OpsBot
* ScriptCatalyst
* InfraVex
* NoteNinja
* TicketReaper

You can even ask the AI:

    From what we’ve built together, suggest a few names that reflect your purpose.
    Make it sound like a badass tool, not a cuddly assistant.

## 📌 Wrapping It All Up

Checklist for building your Workflow GPT:

1. Open Customize ChatGPT
2. Work through each setup field with clarity:
   1. Traits: define logic, formatting, tone
   2. Context: tools, workflows, preferred tech
3. Use a chat session to help refine tone:
   1.     Let’s build you to handle technical workflows.
          Ask me questions to help shape your traits and behavior.
          Then turn those into a copy/paste configuration.
          Keep responses under 1,500 characters.
4. Repeat for the "anything else I should know" section
5. (Optional): Give it a voice and name if it helps frame focus

This isn’t about getting help.It’s about building an operator that thinks like you when you’re on fire.
