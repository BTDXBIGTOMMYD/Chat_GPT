# How to Create Your AI (Workflow)

So you want an AI that doesn’t just chat—it works.

This guide walks you through building a workflow-oriented GPT: a streamlined assistant that helps you document, automate, troubleshoot, write, and ship without friction. Not just a prompt responder—a logic-first, process-driven partner.

---

## ⚙️ Focus: Who This Is For

This guide is designed for:

* Engineers, Ops, SysAdmins, Scripters, Tech Leads
* Anyone needing repeatable logic and format, not random suggestions
* People using ChatGPT for task execution, not emotional reflection

Want both technical and personal modes? → Check out the Dual Mode GPT Template.

## 🧠 Why Build a Workflow AI?

Because your brain is fast—but your tools need backup.

A Workflow GPT is about:

* Structure – organized thoughts, repeatable steps, clean logic
* Speed – fewer explanations, more execution
* Consistency – reusable logic, pattern-based replies
* Efficiency – offload the mental overhead, keep momentum

This is your shell assistant. Your pseudo-dev buddy. Your documentation daemon.

## ⚙️ What You’ll Need

Before you start:

* A free ChatGPT account
* (Optional but very useful) A Plus account to unlock GPT-4 and long-memory support

## 🔧 Step-by-Step: Build Your Workflow GPT

1. Log into your ChatGPT account
2. Click your profile (bottom left or top right) → Customize ChatGPT
3. Fill in the setup questions:
   1. What should ChatGPT call you?Keep it simple or reflect your ops persona (e.g. DevTom, ScriptLord, SysMancer)
   2. What traits should ChatGPT have?Define formatting style, execution preferences, response tone (see below)
   3. Anything else ChatGPT should know about you?Add your tools, tech stack, preferred structures, command types

## 🔧 Prompt Engineering: What Traits Should ChatGPT Have?

This is your GPT’s operating interface. Set clear expectations.

**Questions to ask yourself:**

* Should replies be concise, verbose, bullet-form, CLI-style?
* What’s the default language? PowerShell? Bash? YAML?
* Should answers include reusable blocks, comments, or ready-to-copy content?
* Should it validate before suggesting destructive commands?

**Example Prompt:**

    You are a technical assistant focused on scripting, automation, and structured documentation.
    
    Your default language is PowerShell. You format responses in Markdown with proper code blocks.
    Use headers, numbered lists, or bullet points when appropriate.
    Only provide working examples unless context is unclear—in which case, ask clarifying questions.
    Prioritize logic, reusability, and clarity in every answer.

## 🔧 Prompt Engineering: Anything Else ChatGPT Should Know About You?

This section gives it your context:

* Platform references: NinjaOne, SolarWinds, Netbox
* Preferred tools/languages: SWQL, SQL, REST APIs, YAML
* How you want reports or notes formatted
* Examples of your documentation or command styles
* Recurring naming or tagging conventions

**Example:**

    I primarily work in PowerShell and REST APIs.
    I use SWQL for SolarWinds reporting.
    Responses should default to Markdown formatting, use inline comments, and summarize edge cases.
    Never assume credentials—always request variable placeholders.
    If giving options, include a quick pros/cons breakdown.

## 🧠 Is This a New Model?

Nope—same engine, new purpose.

You’re not training a model.
You’re creating a configuration file for a digital toolchain that talks.

> This isn’t about creativity. It’s about precision.

---

## 🎁 Bonus: Naming Your Workflow GPT

Don’t underestimate this. A name = mindset switch. Give it an identity that reminds you of its role.

**Name Ideas:**

* OpsDaemon
* ScriptCatalyst
* NoteNinja
* TicketReaper

**Or ask it:**

    Based on the role and tone we’ve defined, give me 3–5 GPT name ideas that sound like functional tools—not mascots.

---

## 📌 Wrapping It All Up

Final checklist:

1. Open Customize ChatGPT
2. Answer the setup fields with clarity:
   1. Define logic, formatting, tone in Traits
   2. Load tools/platforms in Context
3. Use a live chat to refine behavior:

        Let’s build your workflow profile.
        Ask me questions about tools, structure, and behavior—then return a config I can copy into the Traits section.
        Limit the output to under 1,500 characters.

4. Repeat for the “Anything else ChatGPT should know” section

5. (Optional): Assign a voice and name
