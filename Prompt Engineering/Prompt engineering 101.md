## 🎯 Prompting 101: How to Get What You Want from an AI (Without Sounding Like a Robot) 
From quick questions to deep dives—how to craft prompts that actually work.

## 🧠 Start Simple: What’s a Prompt, Really?

A prompt is just how you talk to an AI. It's your way of saying:
“Here’s what I need. Here’s the tone. Let’s go.”
Whether you’re solving a technical issue, writing a poem, or venting about a weird dream—you’re guiding the AI. You don’t need perfect grammar or a magic phrase. You just need to be intentional.

## 🎭 Two Core Styles of Prompting

1. Question Prompts
Quick, focused, and ideal for direct answers.
    • Prompt: "What is DNS?"
Common response: “DNS stands for Domain Name System. It translates domain names into IP addresses.”
Great for factual lookups, but limited in scope.
    • Prompt: "What should I eat for dinner?"
Common response: “Some easy options are pasta, stir-fry, salad, or soup.”
Quick and useful, but may not match your mood or cravings without more input.
    • Prompt: "What is anxiety?"
Common response: “Anxiety is a feeling of worry or fear that can be mild or severe, often related to stress or uncertainty.”

2. Task Prompts
Structured like a conversation. Sets a role, tone, or purpose. Great for collaboration and creativity.
    • Prompt: "Act like a network engineer. Explain DNS to someone troubleshooting their home internet."
Common response: “Sure. Think of DNS as the internet’s phone book. If your devices can’t load websites, it might be a DNS issue…”
    • Prompt: "Help me figure out what I actually want to eat tonight. Ask me some questions first."
Common response: “Alright—are you craving something hot or cold? Any dietary restrictions? Do you want comfort food or something healthy?”
    • Prompt: "Explain anxiety to me like I’m trying to describe it to someone who’s never felt it."
Common response: “Imagine your mind is a browser with 47 tabs open, and one of them is playing music you can’t find—except the music is your heartbeat and it’s getting louder…”

## 🪫 What Makes a Less Good Prompt?

Sometimes it’s not that the AI isn’t helpful—it just wasn’t given a chance to be.
Watch out for these:
    • Too vague: “Help me.” (With what?)
    • Missing context: “Fix this code.” (What’s the error? What’s the goal?)
    • Too much at once: “Write me a report, summarize a book, and make dinner plans.”
    • Tone mismatch: Want it casual? Say that. Otherwise, it may default to formal.
Small adjustments = big improvement.

|-----------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
|  				Learn something 			     	|  				“What is imposter syndrome?”  Common 				response: “It’s a psychological 				pattern where people doubt their achievements...” 			 	|  				“Explain imposter syndrome like I’m 				spiraling at 2am.”  Common 				response: “Alright, picture this: 				You’ve done the work, crushed it even, but your brain keeps 				whispering ‘you faked it’...” 			               	|
|  				Solve a tech issue 			  	|  				“How do I restart Apache?”  Common 				response: “Use sudo systemctl 				restart apache2 on Ubuntu.” 			                           	|  				“Act as a Linux admin. Walk me through 				restarting Apache and what to check if it fails.”  Common 				response: “Let’s restart Apache 				using systemctl. If it fails, first check the error logs with...” 			       	|
|  				Plan something 			      	|  				“What should I pack for Iceland?”  Common 				response: “Warm clothes, 				waterproofs, hiking boots...” 			                       	|  				“Build me a packing list for Iceland in 				January. I hate the cold but love hiking.”  Common 				response: “Got it. You’ll want 				thermal layers, insulated waterproof trousers, plus some hand 				warmers...” 			      	|
|  				Reflect on feelings 			 	|  				“What are signs of burnout?”  Common 				response: “Fatigue, lack of 				motivation, reduced performance...” 			                   	|  				“Help me figure out if I’m burnt out or 				just tired. Ask me questions.”  Common 				response: “Alright. First: Are 				you feeling emotionally drained at the end of the day, or is it 				more physical exhaustion?” 			 	|


NOTE: Task prompt responses are usually more detailed and layered than shown here—what’s written is just a small snippet example.

## 🧩 So What Makes a Good Prompt?
You don’t need to overthink it. But a solid prompt often includes:
    • Goal: What do you want to get out of this?
    • Context: A little background goes a long way.
    • Tone: Friendly, formal, funny? Set the mood.
    • Clarity: Be specific, even if casual.
Want better results? Treat prompts like you're texting a smart friend, not filling out a form.

## 🧠 Quick Note on ChatGPT Personalization
If you haven’t customized your AI, responses come from a general tone. If you’ve used “Customize ChatGPT,” your AI will stick to your set preferences—unless you tell it to switch things up.

## 💬 Final Word
Prompting isn’t about writing perfectly—it’s about opening a door.
Whether you need a quick fact, a second brain, or just someone to bounce ideas off, it all starts with how you ask.
Start small. Stay curious. And keep the conversation going.
