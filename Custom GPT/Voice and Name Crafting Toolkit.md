# 🎙️ Voice and Name Crafting Toolkit

You’ve built your GPT.  
Now let’s give it a voice. A name. A presence.

This guide will help you:

- Choose the right voice for your GPT
- Generate name ideas from its role + tone
- Avoid common setup issues with Advanced Voice
- Build a consistent *vibe*

---

## 🎧 Voice: Picking the Right One

Navigate to:  
`Settings → Speech → Voice`

Next to the play button, you are able to setup and use the following voices:

- Vale
- Arbor
- Sol
- Juniper
- Breeze
- Maple
- Spruce
- Ember
- Cove
- Monday

They each sound different—but they don’t all match every tone.

*NOTE*: This is updated overtime, so keep an eye out for different voices that you could use and work with.

## 🚨 Important Note: Advanced Voice Currently Breaks Tone

If you're configuring a **Custom GPT** via “Customize ChatGPT,”  

**you must disable Advanced Voice** in order to keep your GPT’s tone consistent.

### ✅ To Fix

- Go to: `Settings → Speech`
- Scroll to: **Advanced Voice**
- Toggle **OFF** while configuring

If left on, your GPT may ignore its personality or switch tone randomly when speaking.

## 🧠 Name Crafting Prompts

You don’t need a “bot name.” You need a presence.

Here are 3 ways to generate names:

### 🔹 Option 1: Ask the GPT to Name Itself

    Based on the personality we’ve built, what name suits you?  
    Suggest 3–5 options. It should reflect your tone and purpose.  
    Your voice is [X]. Think of this as an identity, not a label.

### 🔹 Option 2: Choose from Archetypes

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

| **Name Style**         | **Example Names**                       | **Vibe / Intent** |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 🕶️ Mysterious / Shadow | Vex, Sol, Veil, Echo, Umbra             | Digital shadow, dark mirror, the whisper in your head |
| 🫂 Emotional / Supportive | Nova, Eden, Drift, Haven, Luma         | Calm, grounding, emotionally safe |
| 💻 Technical / Robotic | Axis, Hex, Compile, Syn, Coreline       | Logical, precise, script-minded |
| 🔥 Chaotic / Sasscore  | Riot, Glitch, Thorn, Snare, Crux        | Unhinged, funny, no-filter responder |
| 🧠 Coach / Mentor       | Clarity, Pulse, Anchor, Emberline, Vox | Encouraging, visionary, structured insight |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

### 🔹 Option 3: Fusion Logic

Combine tone + function:

    [Emotion word] + [System word]
    e.g. SolThread, PulseCache, DreamDaemon, EchoStack

Or use a portmanteau:

    Support + Catalyst → Suppertalyst  
    Reflect + Memory → Reflember

## 📌 Final Checklist

1. Turn off Advanced Voice under Speech settings
2. Choose a voice that matches GPT energy
3. Name your GPT using one of the prompt methods
4. Update your system prompt to include:

        You are [NAME], my personal GPT assistant.
        You operate in [technical/casual] mode based on context.
        Your voice is [X] and your tone reflects my needs.
